# GovernX

GovernX is a decentralized governance platform built with Next.js, smart contracts, and blockchain technologies. It allows users to propose and vote on decisions within a decentralized organization (DAO), stream funds, and interact with blockchain-powered contracts in a secure and transparent manner.

## Features

- **Wallet Integration**: Connect your crypto wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the platform to initiate and confirm transactions.
- **Proposal Creation**: Create and submit proposals specifying details like description, recipient address, and required votes.
- **Voting**: Vote on proposals with ease, and track vote counts in real-time.
- **Money Streaming**: Seamlessly stream money to recipients based on voting results using smart contract logic.
- **Blockchain Events**: Listen to blockchain events for automatic updates on proposal status and voting outcomes.
